I- Highway 7 through Alder and Elbe

There is no better approximation of a Bob Ross painting

A bare wooden barn, its peak ambitious like a chapel's

A yellow cross made of Christmas lights affixed to its side

Black conifers sprinkled with white

A cream colored house, hunched figure shoveling snow in the drive

Plush fog drapes the hills and spills into sleeping pastures 

The still lake mirrors its surrounding slopes and sky

Artfully myopic 

I consider my future self and a summer cabin

With a view out the back of the ivory slopes of Mt Rainier.
