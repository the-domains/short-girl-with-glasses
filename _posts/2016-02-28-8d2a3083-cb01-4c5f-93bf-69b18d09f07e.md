Sometimes by welcoming someone new into my life, I can learn
something about myself.

"Why do you always fold your towels into thirds?" he asked.
This, coming from a guy who only folds his towels in half sometimes, or
otherwise lays them, carefree, across the length of the towel rack.

This memory returned to me as I brought a bath towel under
my chin, methodically and automatically bringing the edges toward the
center. One by one. I laid the towel onto the rack, tugging it so
it laid just so. I picked up another
towel.

"You don't need to do that," Mom told me when I was a
child. I watched her thoughtlessly and
efficiently fold the clothes one by one as they left the drier. Appropriately folded, they landed uniformly
in the hamper. Shirts, undies, pants,
towels.Each had its own procedure. I had picked up a lush bath towel, watching
her with a furrowed brow. How did she
fold it so perfectly? Too small to use
my chin to hold the towel in place, I laid the towel on the floor and slowly
copied her folds. I was getting in her
way. "Don't worry about it," she reassured me, probably wanting me to stop
gumming up the works.

A child fascinated by knot-making and Origami, I couldn't
forget the satisfying way that Mom's towels rested on the towel racks. Not only did they look plump and rich, and
dry quickly, but they also made room for more towels on the same rack. Over time, I mastered her folding techniques
until it was as easy and automatic as it seemed to her. Maybe fifteen years later, having someone
question me about something so intrinsic to my daily routine left me speechless
at first. Why did I fold my towels into
thirds?

When I moved out of my parents' house and needed to make a dorm
a home, I folded my towel. The morning
after I heard my Mom's cancer had returned, I folded my towel. When I visited hotels around the world, I
folded my towel. Sometimes I visit my
parents and fold their towels for them. Even where Mom's towel folding technique has dulled, or is simply
inappropriate due there being more pressing issues, I fill in the gaps. Eagerly and automatically. See, there is something about folding towels.
If the towels lie just so on their racks, then there is continuity. There is beauty. There is efficiency. There is tradition. There is something permanent, however
miniscule and mundane, passed on through the generations.
