"Her cancer is back."

"Oh no."

"Do you want me to leave?

"You don't have to pretend you're not stressed out."

"No, stay.

"Let's watch something."

Roused by

The dog's pallid whine

Nose itching from cast off fur

Eyes aching

Tears return with the sun

3

The liminal radio station

Expresses a fluidity

I breathe out.

"Some birds molt all of their feathers."

"American embassy targeted."

Shifting static

Noncommittal

Even the dog seems weird

Pausing, resisting

It's too much, being shut away

In the bathroom

I concur. 

Tuck tail and run.
