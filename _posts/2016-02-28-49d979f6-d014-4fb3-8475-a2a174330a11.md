1

"Her cancer is back."

"Oh no."

"Do you want me to leave?

"You don't have to pretend you're not stressed out."

"No, stay.

"Let's watch something."

2

Roused by

The dog's pallid whine

Nose itching from cast off fur

Eyes aching

Tears return with the sun

3

The liminal radio station

Expresses a fluidity

I breathe out.

"Some birds molt all of their feathers."

"American embassy targeted."

Shifting static

Noncommittal

4

Even the dog seems weird

Pausing, resisting

It's too much, being shut away

In the bathroom

I concur. 

Tuck tail and run.
